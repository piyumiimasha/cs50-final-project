#Expense Tracker

####Description:

 USER AUTHENTICATION- Each user can register with a unique username and a secure password. During registration, usernames are validated to ensure uniqueness, preventing duplicate accounts. Passwords are securely stored using hashing, protecting user credentials from unauthorized access. Once registered, users can log in to access their personalized dashboard, where all their data is displayed privately. User sessions are maintained using secure cookies, so they can remain logged in across page visits. Users can also log out securely to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring each user's data is isolated and protected.
ADD EXPENSES- Users can track individual expenses by entering specific details such as the date, category, amount, and an optional description. For example, they might categorize expenses as "Groceries," "Transport," or "Entertainment" to organize their spending. The date field records when the expense occurred, making it easy to track historical spending. The category helps users group similar expenses, enabling insights into where most of their money goes. The amount field supports both whole numbers and decimal values, allowing for precise tracking. Lastly, the description field is optional, providing space for notes like store names or specific items purchased. This level of detail makes it easier to analyze spending habits and identify potential areas for saving.
BUDGET MANAGEMENT-Users can set a monthly budget to manage their expenses better. This budget represents the maximum amount they plan to spend within a month. For instance, a user might allocate $500 for January and $600 for February. The month field specifies the relevant month and year, while the amount field stores the allocated budget. This feature helps users monitor their spending and alerts them when they approach or exceed their budget. By comparing actual spending with the set budget, users gain valuable insights, which can encourage them to stay within limits and adjust spending goals over time.
SUMMARY OF EXPENSES- The application provides a summary view where users can see an organized list of their expenses, sorted by date or category. This view helps users understand their spending patterns, as they can see how much they spent on various categories or specific dates. The summary section calculates the total amount spent each month and compares it to the monthly budget. If spending exceeds the budget, a warning highlights the overspending, helping users recognize patterns that may need adjustment. Additionally, users can access a report for each month showing their total spending, the remaining budget balance, and a breakdown of expenses by category. This report encourages mindful spending by showing how much they have left to spend.
MANAGE DATA IN THE APPLICATION- All user data, including registration information, expenses, and budgets, is securely stored in an SQLite database. This database ensures data consistency and quick access, making it efficient for the application to handle multiple users. The User table stores usernames and hashed passwords for managing authentication, ensuring privacy and security. The Expense table links individual expenses to each user, storing details such as the date, category, amount, and description. The Budget table maintains monthly budgets for each user, enabling personalized budget management.
TECHNOLOGIES USED- Flask serves as the main web framework, managing routing, user sessions, and handling requests. It enables efficient handling of user authentication and page rendering. Flask-SQL Alchemy, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), simplifies database interactions, allowing data to be stored and retrieved from SQLite without direct SQL commands.HTML/CSS is used to design templates, forms, and the visual layout of the application. CSS provides styling to make the interface intuitive and visually appealing.
This feature-rich application helps users manage expenses, monitor budgets, and develop responsible financial habits, offering a practical solution for daily financial tracking.
